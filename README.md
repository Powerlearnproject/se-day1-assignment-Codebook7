Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the application of engineering principles and methods to develop and maintain software products. Software applications have been used to solve problems in healthcare, communication and many aspects of modern life. 

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Software engineering evolved through the following key milestones: 
* The development of programing languages such as Foltran. 
* The development of software engineering as a discipline in the 1970s
* The development of standard methodologies in the 2000s. 

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
The Development of Software applications undergoes the following process: 
*Requirements: surveying user needs and documenting system requirements.
* Design: creating detailed software architecture and user interface.
* Implementation: Writing code and building software according to requirement specifications
* Testing: conducting various tests to ensure software meets quality standards and customer demand.
* Deployment: launching the software to customers
* Maintenance: the provision of updates to software to enhance user utility.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
 The Waterfall methodology involves a sequential approach to software engineering practices, and is most suitable in the early development of a software.  On the other hand, Agile methodology favours an iterative approach to software engineering practices. it is most suitable in the testing and maintenance of a software. 

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer: Writing codes and designing software. 
Quality Assurance Engineer: Testing of software against quality standards. 
Project Manager: Management of the software development process.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the sh
software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments: For writing and  debugging codes.
Version Control Systems: For collaboration and optimal design of development projects. 

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges. 
A major problem facing software engineers is changing requirements. it can be overcome with the practice of agile methodologies.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
* unit testing: Testing of individual components of a software.
* Integratio testing: The testing of the interaction   between the components and subsystems of a software.
* System testing: testing of a software as a whole.
* Acceptance testing: the testing of a software against quality standards and customer demand.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering can be defined as the query of an AI model in a manner that suits the context of a problem.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Example of a vague prompt: "Tell me about cats"

An improved version of prompt: Give me a brief history of cats in Africa. 

The improved version of the vague prompt is more effective because it is efficiently situated around a descriptive context.
